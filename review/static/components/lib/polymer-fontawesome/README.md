Polymer approach to Font Awesome


All credit for the amazing Font Awesome library and its icons goes to Dave Gandy - http://fontawesome.io

Polymer-FontAwesome was started as an experiment with Polymer. The goal was to expose all of the class-based functionality of Font Awesome as attributes on an easy to use element. Though it is still an experiment, things seem to function as expected.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. I have learned a lot about Polymer basics from this simple example, and am eager to learn more.
